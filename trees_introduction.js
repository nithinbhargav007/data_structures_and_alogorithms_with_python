// In a perfectly balanced binary tree - we get number of nodes in power of 2
//Level 0 : 2^0 =1;
// Level 1 = 2 nodes
// Level 2 = 4 nodes

//log N will tell how many times we search / traverse the tree to find the required node

// BINARY SEARCH TREE

//When we traverse to the right --> Value always increase
//When we traverse to the left  --> Value always decreases

// Disadvantage of binary search tree
// 1. If we keep adding element to the right, the time complexity increases to O(n)
// 2. there are other algorithms or trees like AVL to balance the binary search tree
